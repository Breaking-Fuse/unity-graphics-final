# Unity Graphics Final
 A Unity project in VR that implements various graphics-oriented techniques and DOTS.

<h1>My Road Map:</h1>
 <h2>Categories</h2>
My Final Project is <b>3D</b>.</br>
My Target Platform is <b>Unity</b>.</br>
In Unity, <b>I Do plan to have an XR outcome</b> (Oculus VR) using the Headset and Touch Controllers.</br>
I have the <b>Oculus Rift CV1 (Headset + Touch controllers) ready and available.</b></br>
My GitHub repo is at: https://github.com/Breaking-Fuse/unity-graphics-final
 <h2>Specifics</h2>
<h3>Your main theme for the project is:</h3>
 	<b>Rendering/Shaders</b> and Use of <b>VR for Locomotion/Interaction</b>.
<h3>The most interesting/challenging graphics-oriented techniques you are going to try and implement are:</h3>
I am still not as experienced with Unity as some others, but the challenging techniques I will be implementing revolve around: applying shaders to the environment, having object shaders change due to the player’s interactions, and having it all run in VR.

Note: I also have an NVIDIA RTX graphics card on my PC. If I feel like challenging myself even more, I will try to get real-time Raytracing into my project.
<h3>Of those techniques, the highest risk, “scariest” part is:</h3>
 	Applying/Implementing Shaders that will change based on the environment/ player’s interaction. (Or, Ray tracing, if I add it)
<h3>An initial demo that lets me know I am working towards mitigating the highest risk part of the project would show:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stable framerates (which I’ll try to get as high as possible)</li>
<li>No (unexpected) artifacts in Rendering/Lighting</li>
<li>VR movement and interaction are smooth and easy to understand</li>
<li>Clean HLSL that is as simple as possible but capable</li>
</ul>
